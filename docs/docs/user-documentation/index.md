### How the Three-Cycle System Works

The core feature of the Eretz Realty Admin System is its innovative three-cycle distribution approach:

1. **Cycle Assignment**: Each property listing is assigned to one of three cycles (Cycle 1, 2, or 3)
2. **Weekly Rotation**: Email campaigns rotate through the cycles on a weekly schedule
3. **Subscriber Engagement**: Subscribers receive different property selections each week, preventing fatigue
4. **Continuous Exposure**: All properties receive regular exposure through the rotation system

This approach ensures that:
- Subscribers never receive the same properties twice in consecutive weeks
