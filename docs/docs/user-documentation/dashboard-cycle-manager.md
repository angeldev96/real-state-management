# Dashboard & Cycle Manager

The Dashboard, also known as the **Cycle Manager**, is your main workspace in the Eretz Realty Admin System. It provides a comprehensive overview of your three-cycle distribution system and quick access to your property listings.

## Accessing the Dashboard

- Click the **home icon** in the sidebar, or
- Click **Cycle Manager** in the sidebar navigation
- The Dashboard is the default landing page after login

## Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard is organized into several key sections:

### Summary Statistics Cards

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find four summary cards displaying key metrics:

#### Total Listings
- Displays the total number of properties in your system
- Includes both active and archived listings
- Provides a quick overview of your inventory size

#### New Listings
- Shows the count of properties marked as "New"
- These properties display with a "NEW" badge in email campaigns
- Useful for tracking recently added or featured properties

#### Active Listings
- Displays the number of currently active properties
- Only active listings are included in email campaigns
- Archived properties are excluded from this count

#### Next Cycle
- Indicates which cycle will be sent next (Cycle 1, 2, or 3)
- Helps you plan and prepare upcoming campaigns
- Updates automatically based on your rotation schedule

### Cycle Tabs

Below the summary cards, you'll find three tabs representing each distribution cycle:

- **Cycle 1 Tab**
- **Cycle 2 Tab**
- **Cycle 3 Tab**

Click any tab to view the properties assigned to that specific cycle.

## Understanding Cycle Information

Each cycle tab displays:

### Cycle Statistics

At the top of each tab:

- **Total Properties**: Number of listings assigned to this cycle
- **Active Properties**: Number of active listings (excluding archived)
- **New Properties**: Number of properties marked as "New" in this cycle
- **Next Send Date**: The scheduled date and time for the next email campaign for this cycle

### Property Listings View

Below the statistics, you'll see all properties assigned to the selected cycle, organized by property type:

#### Property Type Sections

Properties are grouped by type (e.g., Apartment, Commercial, Land) for better organization. Each section displays:

- **Property Type Header**: The category name
- **Property Count**: Number of properties in this type within the cycle

#### Property Cards

Each property is displayed in a card format showing:

1. **Property ID & Status**
   - Unique property identifier
   - "NEW" badge (green) if marked as new
   - "ARCHIVED" badge (gray) if inactive

2. **Address**
   - Full property address
   - Primary identifier for the property

3. **Location Description**
   - Neighborhood or area details
   - Additional location context

4. **Property Details**
   - Dimensions
   - Number of rooms
   - Square footage
   - Property condition

5. **Financial Information**
   - Price (formatted with thousand separators or "M" for millions)
   - Example: "$2.7M" for $2,700,000

6. **Additional Information**
   - Features (e.g., Renovated, Parking, Garden)
   - Zoning code
   - Property type

7. **Action Button**
   - **Edit Button**: Click to modify property details

## Interpreting Dashboard Data

### Cycle Distribution

A well-balanced distribution typically has:

- **Similar Property Counts**: Each cycle should have roughly equal numbers of properties
- **Mix of Property Types**: Variety in each cycle keeps campaigns interesting
- **New Properties Spread**: Distribute "new" properties across all cycles

### Planning Your Cycles

Use the Dashboard to:

1. **Monitor Balance**: Ensure no single cycle is overloaded or empty
2. **Track New Listings**: See how many new properties each cycle contains
3. **Prepare for Campaigns**: Review properties before their scheduled send date
4. **Identify Gaps**: Spot cycles that need more properties

### Best Practices

#### Optimal Cycle Size

- Aim for 10-30 properties per cycle for effective emails
- Too few: Recipients may find campaigns sparse
- Too many: Emails become overwhelming and difficult to read

#### Property Distribution

- **Variety**: Include different property types in each cycle
- **Price Range**: Mix high-end and affordable properties
- **Geographic Spread**: Distribute properties from different locations across cycles
- **Status Mix**: Include both new and established listings

#### Regular Maintenance

- **Weekly Review**: Check the Dashboard before each campaign send
- **Update New Status**: Move older "new" properties to regular status
- **Archive Sold Properties**: Mark sold properties as archived promptly
- **Rebalance**: Periodically adjust property assignments to maintain balance

## Dashboard Workflow Examples

### Weekly Campaign Preparation

1. Open the Dashboard on your campaign day (e.g., Monday)
2. Check the **Next Cycle** indicator to see which cycle sends today
3. Click the corresponding cycle tab
4. Review all properties in that cycle
5. Verify accuracy of information
6. Update any outdated details
7. Ensure all intended properties are active
8. Monitor the email send (check Schedule page for send time)

### Adding New Properties

1. Receive new property listing information
2. Click **Add Listing** from the Dashboard
3. Enter all property details
4. Choose the cycle with the fewest properties (for balance)
5. Mark as "New" if recently added
6. Save the listing
7. The property immediately appears in its assigned cycle tab

### Monthly Cycle Review

1. Navigate through each cycle tab (1, 2, 3)
2. Review property counts and distribution
3. Identify any imbalances
4. Move properties between cycles if needed (via Edit function)
5. Archive sold or outdated properties
6. Add new properties to less-populated cycles

## Empty State

If a cycle has no properties:

- A message will display: "No listings found for this cycle"
- Click **Add Listing** to add properties to the cycle
- Ensure you assign the property to the correct cycle number when creating

## Tips for Effective Dashboard Use

1. **Start Here Daily**: Make the Dashboard your starting point each day
2. **Quick Health Check**: The summary cards give you instant system status
3. **Pre-Send Review**: Always review the next cycle before it sends
4. **Use Filters**: Switch between cycles quickly using tabs
5. **Visual Scanning**: Card view makes it easy to spot issues visually
6. **Balance Monitoring**: Check that all three cycles have adequate properties

## Common Questions

**Q: How often should I check the Dashboard?**
A: Review the Dashboard at least once before each scheduled email send, and whenever adding new properties.

**Q: Can I reorder properties within a cycle?**
A: Properties are automatically ordered by property type and ID. Manual reordering is not currently supported.

**Q: What happens if a cycle has no properties?**
A: The system will still attempt to send an email, but it will be empty. Always ensure each cycle has active properties.

**Q: How do I move a property from one cycle to another?**
A: Click the Edit button on the property card, change the "Cycle Group" field to the desired cycle (1, 2, or 3), and save.
